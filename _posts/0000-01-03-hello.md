Hey, my name is Elina. I don't really know what I'm doing... Github is kind of confusing for me, and I just started using it last week :p

Um... I programmed in gr 4 using Arduino for Lego League. We won something... I kind of forget what it was for :') All I remember is that we got a TROPHY!!! :))
