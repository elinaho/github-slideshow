title: "Coding Experience"

Personally, I'd say my coding experience is basically *non-existant* but I guess that's not 100% true...

- I coded in grade 4 on Arduino for Lego League ~~Oh wait, I already wrote that~~  :joy:

- I also went to GoCodeGirl from grade 7 - 9... it's basically a thing where you code, but it's all girls :girl:
  
- Grade 10 Processing class... I guess you could say it was a blast :tada:
  
- And then I also did E-Cubed this past summer (2018)... this one I just made an app
